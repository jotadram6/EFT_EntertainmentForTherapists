EXO-15-006

Single-electron trigger: ET > 105 or 115 GeV and loose electron identification criteria

The offline reconstructed pT  greater than 130 GeV

Electron isolation in the tracker is ensured by requiring the pT sum of all tracks within a cone of
∆R = 0.3 centered around the track of the electron candidate and originating
from the same primary vertex, to be less than 5 GeV

ECAL isolation is defined as the ET sum of the energy deposits within a ∆R= 0.3 cone
around the electron candidate, ECAL isolation is required to be below 3% of the electron’s ET

The HCAL isolation considers the energy deposits in the hadronic calorimeter within a cone of ∆R = 0.15 around the electron’s direction.
It must be less than 5% of the electron’s energy deposit in the ECAL

To reduce the Drell–Yan background events with additional electrons of ET > 35 GeV are rejected

Muon isolation requires that the scalar pT sum of all tracks originating from the interaction vertex within a ∆R =0.3 cone around its direction, excluding the muon itself, be less than 10% of the muon’s pT

To further reduce the Drell-Yan background the event must not have a second muon with pT > 25 GeV.

the pseudorapidity region |η| <2.0 is used in the muon channel

|∆φ(plT,pmissT)| > 2.5 -------> |Delta Phi (lepton pT, Mising transverse momentum)| > 2.5

0.4 < pT(l)/EmissT < 1.5
